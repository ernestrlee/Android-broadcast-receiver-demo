# Android Broadcast Receiver Demo

This app is a demo of using broadcast receivers in Android.  The first broadcast receiver is a custom
broadcast receiver that is triggered using a button.  The second broadcast receiver is triggered when
the device batter is low.  A toast message is displayed when a broadcast is received.

This lesson was part of the Android Developer Fundamentals Unit 3 Lesson 7.3.
